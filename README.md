# Library-Computer-Usage-Analysis




## Goals: Establish which characteristics make a computer more likely to be used, including campus scheduling, equipment configuration, placement, population in the library, and area weather. Using this data, this project would like to use machine learning to determine the best placement of computers for future allocation, and possible reconfiguration of equipment and space.

### Suggested Reading Order: To get the highlights, look at the Presentation powerpoint. For more detailed information and examples, begin with LibraryGateCounts. Move to UsageByMachine, then UsageByRegion. Follow that with UsageVsWeather and WindowAndMonitorUsageCorrelations. Finally PredictUsageByAttributes finishes off the set.

## Python notebooks:

### LibraryGateCounts: Shows the total population in Jackson library each day and its correlation to semester schedule, as well as use of particular areas in the library.

### UsageByMachine: Shows the total usage of each machine in Jackson Library by a percentage of each hour. Visualization shows that some regions are more heavily used than others, and at what times.

### UsageVsWeather: Shows the relation between total use of a given computer vs local temperature and rainfall, broken down by region. Results indicate that weather has no meaningful effect on computer use.

### WindowAndMonitorUsageCorrelations: Shows that computers with dual monitors are used more heavily than those with only one from spring 2016 - fall 2017, and that a computer's adjacency to a window has no effect on computer use during the same period.
