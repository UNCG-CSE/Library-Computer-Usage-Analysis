### Library Machine Codes

Machines in the library have names based upon their location. They are in the form ABCD-0123 where 'ABCD' is a three- or four-letter code designating their location, followed by three or four numbers. For example: CRR-025 would be in the Current Periodicals and Reading Room, on the first floor to the right, from the perspective of a patron entering from the College Ave. entrance. Others include:

1) TL2: Tower Lobby 2nd floor
2) INC or INCO: Information Commons, first floor
