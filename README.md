# Library-Computer-Usage-Analysis
The University Libraries at UNCG currently track the state of a computer, determining whether or not a particular computer is in use. This data is compiled into a database, and a web app pulls from this database to show a map and number of available computers. At this point, the data has not been used to determine which computers are used more frequently, aside from counting the number of times a computer transitions into/away from the 'in-use' state.  This project would attempt to correlate the usage of these computers with various factors, including: campus scheduling, equipment configuration, placement, population in the library, and area weather. Using this data, this project would like to use machine learning to determine the best placement of computers for future allocation, and possible reconfiguration of equipment and space.

## Primary goals:
# Find:
    1. Calculate total time computer in use per day, per semester, etc.
    2. Compare 1) against frequency of inclement rainfall
    3. Compare 1) against times of exams
    4. Compare 1) against libary populaton
