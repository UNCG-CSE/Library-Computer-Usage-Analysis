# Library-Computer-Usage-Analysis


## Goals: Establish which characteristics make a computer more likely to be used, including campus scheduling, equipment configuration, placement, population in the library, and area weather. Using this data, this 
project would like to use machine learning to determine the best placement of computers for future allocation, and possible reconfiguration of equipment and space.

## Python notebooks:

### LibraryGateCounts: Shows the total population in Jackson library each day and its correlation to semester schedule, as well as use of particular areas in the library.

### Semester_Analysis: Shows that computers with dual monitors are used more heavily than those with only one from spring 2016 - fall 2017, and that a computer's adjacency to a window has no effect on computer use during the same period.
